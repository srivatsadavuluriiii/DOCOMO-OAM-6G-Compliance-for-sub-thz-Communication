# Analysis Scripts

This directory contains analysis scripts for the OAM 6G project.

## Files

- **`analyze_three_way_relationship.py`**: Analyzes the complex three-way relationship between handover count, distance, and throughput in OAM 6G systems. Provides comprehensive visualizations and recommendations for system optimization.

- **`analyze_throughput_handover_tradeoff.py`**: Analyzes the fundamental tradeoff between throughput and handover frequency in orbital angular momentum (OAM) based wireless communication systems.

## Usage

```bash
# Run three-way relationship analysis
python analysis/analyze_three_way_relationship.py

# Run throughput-handover tradeoff analysis
python analysis/analyze_throughput_handover_tradeoff.py
```

## Output

Both scripts generate:
- Comprehensive statistical analysis
- Performance recommendations
- Visualization plots (saved as PNG files)
- System design implications
