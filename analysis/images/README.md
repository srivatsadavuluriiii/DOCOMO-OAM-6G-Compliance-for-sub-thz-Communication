# Analysis Images

This directory contains visualization outputs from analysis scripts.

## Images

### `three_way_relationship_analysis.png`
- **Generated by**: `analysis/analyze_three_way_relationship.py`
- **Purpose**: Shows relationships between Distance, Handovers, and Throughput
- **Key Insights**:
  - Distance has the strongest impact on throughput
  - Higher handover frequencies can improve performance at shorter distances
  - Near distances (50-100m) show highest throughput potential

### `throughput_handover_tradeoff_analysis.png`
- **Generated by**: `analysis/analyze_throughput_handover_tradeoff.py`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the trade-off between throughput and handover frequency
- **Key Insights**:
  - Shows throughput distribution by OAM mode
  - Demonstrates SINR vs Throughput relationship
  - Illustrates distance impact on performance

## Usage

These images are used for:
1. **Research Documentation**: Supporting papers and reports
2. **Performance Analysis**: Understanding system behavior
3. **Optimization Validation**: Verifying distance optimization effectiveness
